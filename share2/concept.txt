I Past

0.Young rebels with a noble cause
	* We were a group of hackers in our late teens and early twenties, decided to defent a righteous
	cause in Macedonia. 
	* To promote free software, an unknown public good, in the region were piracy reigned and Microsoft, Adobe, Corel, 
	  were reguriting people by the dosens. 
	* People were starting companies based on "free" pirated Microsoft software. 
	* A new economy was being born in republics of the former yugoslavia. 
	* We felt that it was a tricky proposal, and we wanted our voice to be heard.
	
1.Promoting free software, free culture and open standards
	* We gathered together, and founded a grass roots organisation to
	* promote and explore the technical and technological as well as
	* social and economical effects of free software on our society.
	* Actually we later learned that, we had the same "hacker ethics" of
	  the hackers of MIT of the late 70s of the 20th century
		*  Sharing
		*  Openness
		*  Decentralization
		*  Free access to computers
		* -World- (Let's be modest) Community Improvement :)
		* Community and colaboration
	* We had a website, we had mailing list(s), an rss agregator, we setup the infrastructure both technical, organisational and legal.
	* A community was being born, from people who shared the idea that free software was "The right thing to do."
	* Shared a set of common values, about sharing, helping, about openness.

2. Couple of hacks & failures
	* We actually did a couple of hacks our selves
	* We organized several localization marathons, we localized the
	* complete desktop stack in Macedonian, OpenOffice, Mozilla, KDE,
	* GNOME, etc.
	* We organized the "Free software flood", on the Microsoft Vizija
	* conference in Skopje, were we handout GNU/Linux CDs to participants
	* in front of the conference venue.
	* We hacked OLPC computers to help the UNDP pilot in 
	  Macedonia suceed.
	* We gave lectures to university students, we attended debates and we
	* cooprated with domestic and foreign organisations
3.Community is shrinking
	* People got employed, graduated from univeristy, were at their
	* turning point in their lives and career.
	* Some of the move out of the country, the community was shrinking
	* The organisation could no longer promote free software activelly,
	* We could not get projects were, we have to commit 5-6 people for
	* couple of months to work, hence we could not get steady and stable
	* inflow of finances.
	* At the same time we visited a couple of regional gatherings, NSND,
	* Yaxwe, we went to attend CCC in Berlin, we networked with the
	* croatian, serbian and bosnian community.
4.Reboot
	* Somthing had to be done, or we would have lost our community
	* We saw that physical spaces started to pop up, Monteparadiso Hacklab
	* in Pula, Metalab in Vienna, MaMa in Zagreb.
	* We needed this physical presence to ensure continuity and to
	* reachout to people out side of our shrinking free software
	* community. 
	* We took the risk and in 2009, in early september, I made a call for
	* participation and people pledged money for rent we were going to
	* fund a hacklab. Finally.
	

II Present

5.Hacker culture and free software

* Actually we later learned that, we shared the same "hacker ethics"
		* Sharing
		* Openness
		* Decentralization
		* Free access to computers
		* -World- (Let's be modest) Community Improvement :)
		* Community and colaboration
It seems that these are the actual values that we from the free software
community shared, so all of a sudden we felt like we knew what we were doing.
We were there once before, in the past, when we build our free software
community. Now we had to be a little bit broader, to attract people intrested in
technology and to promote the hacker etics.

7.Community run space Narodna Tehnika
* In an half empty, half ruined, building from 1949 in the former
	* premises of the geological institute we found refuge
	* Together with a group of artist we shared rent, it was like Berlin
	* in the 1990s, a semi like squat, a fully run community space.
	
	* We actually rebuild the computer section of the popular Narodna Tehnika in
	former yugoslavia. Right at the moment when the actual Nardona Tehnika
	building, and infrastructure got sold and a university for toursim and
	business evicted the previous space.
8. Couple of hacks & failures
   * Hacker spaces Buld 
	* KIKA 1.0 finished, deprecateded
	* Of course we failed, the artists made a electric bill of about 1000
	* eur, and the building was about to be condemned, so we had to stop
	* our activities.
	
	* But we also succedded, we saw that it could be done, that people
	* came, and found value in the hacker community, that they participaed
	* in the weekly events and activities.
	* That people would contribute a part of their monthly income, to
	* support our hackerspace and the activities that were happening
	* there.
	* We had our free software community as the core, and we manage to
	* expand it with other people that loved and shared our ideas about
		* Sharing
		* Openness
		* Decentralization
		* Free access to computers
		* -World- (Let's be modest) Community Improvement :)
		* Community and colaboration

	
8. Activites
	* Gnu/Linux/Android first aid
	* Programmming languages
	* Knowledge sharing
	* GSOC (Google Summer of Code)
	* GNOME Women Outreach
	* Hardware hacking
	* We build the led cube.
	* Small but manu different infrastructure project for the hacklab
	* itself
	* A weekly radio show for digital freedom called "This song dosn't
	* have an owner" on Kanal 103, a cult radion station born inside the 
vomb od the public media service Macedonian Radion Television

III Future

9. 
	*Establish a more direct cooperation outside of NSND events between the
three hackerspaces in Zagreb, Belgrade and Skopje.
	* Make them three acess points of a decentralized network for sharing
	* knwoledge and colaborate during events, make the necessary
	* infrastruture for that.
	* Continue and improve the runnuing of KIKA
 	* Expect new events and new activities from the the next generation
	* We have yet to prove our reputation and be the change that we want
	* to see in society
	* We have to escape the trap that KIKA is only a place where trolls
	* hang out, drink beer and nag.
	* We have to attain continuity and build upon previous efforts, reuse,
	* remix and recycle.
	* So far we have financial stability, we have to make sure this stays
	* like that
	
Conclusions

# A small group of people, made a change when they started Free Software
# Macedonia 10 years ago
# A community was created to help that small group of people so we can grow
# and expand, but still share our ideas and values
# That community decayed over time, but with the help of a small group of
# people that shared the original ideas and hacker ethichs managed to emerge 
as the founding force behind the KIKA hacklab in Skopje
# Now a new community is being born on top of the core of our previous
# community, they don't share our exact ideas, as we have not shared the exact ideas of
# our predesessors,they live and communicate, not via email nor IM, but using twitter DM and
# facebook statuses, but that not good nor bad. It just is, how it is.
# But lets see what the future holds for everyone.
# There are many ideas and visions of what KIKA should be, and how it should
# look like but let's leave that for the future.
